   **** Notes about INTERFACES ****

1) You cannot create objects from interfaces (they are incomplete structures because they do not have constructors).
        2) Interfaces can only be parents in the relationship with classes.
        3) Interfaces are created to store things that must be done.
        Hence, interfaces are also called "to-do lists".

         child         parent
         class           class     ==> extends
         interface       interface ==> extends
         class           interface ==> implements
         interface       class     ==> not possible ***

         4) We can place methods with the same name in multiple interface parents
        like putting a run() method inside Motor, Air Conditioning, and Brake. When a child class overrides
        this method, it is unclear from which interface the method comes.

        5) Variables in interfaces are by default public static final. So, it is optional to write them.

        6) We can place variables with the same name in all interfaces. Since they are static and accessed
         through the interface, it is not a problem.

       7) Normally, you cannot place concrete methods inside an interface but in some special cases,
    if you need to put concrete methods;
        a) You can do this using the default keyword.
        b) You can do this using the static keyword.

    ==>  To access concrete methods created with the 'static' keyword, you do not need to create an object.
    The interface name is sufficient.

    ==>  To access concrete methods created with the 'default' keyword, you can create an object from the interface’s child class.

***Interview Question***

     8) What are the differences between an Abstract Class and an Interface?

    a) Abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
       However, interfaces contain abstract methods generally.
       But, in interfaces, if we want, we can create concrete methods using the 'default' and 'static' keywords.

    b) Abstract classes do not support multiple inheritance, but interfaces do.

    c) Abstract classes can contain all types of variables, variables in interfaces must be
      public, static, and final.

    d) An interface cannot be a child of a concrete class. An abstract class can be a child of a concrete class.

    e) Abstract classes have constructors (a concrete method can override this constructor as it wishes)
    but cannot create objects, interfaces DO NOT have constructors, hence cannot create objects.


   What is the significance of using the 'implements' keyword in Java?

       The 'implements' keyword in Java is used to indicate that a class is implementing an interface.
       When a class implements an interface, it agrees to provide concrete implementations for all the abstract
       methods declared in that interface.

       Describe a scenario where using an interface would be more beneficial than using an abstract class.

       Using an interface in Java is often more beneficial when you need to define a contract that can be applied
       across unrelated classes or when you want to achieve multiple inheritance.
       Here’s a scenario that highlights
       why using an interface would be advantageous over an abstract class:

       Scenario: Defining Common Behavior Across Unrelated Classes
       Imagine you are designing a system with various types of entities like a Printer, Car, and Smartphone.
       All of these entities can have a common capability: they can be powered on and powered off,
       but they do not share any common state or belong to the same class hierarchy. Since these entities are
       fundamentally different, using an interface to define this shared behavior is ideal.
