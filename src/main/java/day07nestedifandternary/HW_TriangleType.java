        Type code that takes three integers a, b, and c as the sides of a triangle and

If all three sides are equal: "Equilateral".
If two sides are equal: "Isosceles".
If no sides are equal: "Scalene".
If the three sides do not form a valid triangle (i.e., violate the triangle inequality theorem), output: "Not a Triangle".
